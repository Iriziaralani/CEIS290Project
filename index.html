        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <hr>
        <p class="intro">I used to be an "outdoor cat", and I spent my time outside, chasing mice and birds. When my family adopted me, I continued to go outside and enjoy nature. However, in my old age of about 17 years old -- the equivalent of 84 years for a human -- my humans have begun to keep me indoors. I am not a fan of this, but am able to cope by sneaking outside when they are not looking. My favorite foods are treats, chicken, and tuna.</p>

                <h3>Piano</h3>
                <p>Throughout my career as a professional cat, I have become quite adept at playing the piano. My skillset includes songs such as <b>Random Notes</b>, <b>Cat Walking Across Piano</b>, and <b>Cat Sitting on Piano</b>. These songs are mastered only by the most skilled of musicians, as they require one to play random notes with no plan or purpose whatsoever.</p>

                <h3>Food Imitation</h3>
                <p>Another one of my most valuable skills is that of food imitation. I am able to imitate a <b>cinnamon roll</b> and a <b>loaf of bread</b>! Such skills are of the upmost importance and are achieved only by the most amazing of food imitators.</p>
